# Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark / PySpark MLlib
The machine learning project ultilized Pyspark Mlib to predict housing prices based on a number of characteristics

## How to use this repo? ##
* This repo demonstrates a case for structuring Pyspark code and training a machine-learning model to predict housing prices as the following steps:
1. Import the dataset and explore it.
2. Processing the data.
3. Train the model.
4. Make prediction.
5. Evaluate the model.

Review the jupyter notebook for the detail explaination in each step.
